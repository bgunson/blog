## About

I intend to use this site, or "blog" for that matter to post about things in my life whether it's related to software, fishing, or vehicle maintenance, all things I love to do. The hope is
my posts here can show the type of person I am day to day, or provide informative dialogs which may help ease ssomeones frsutration. I want to look back at the posts here and be able to resonate with
my old self and use it to gauge the progress I make personally and professionally. Thanks for coming by and check out some of my projects or keep reading about me below.
